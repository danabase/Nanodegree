Dear v_dana,
I should have read the articles from P0 when we first started back in October, but at least I just read them now. By now you have been acquainted with:  

 [ ] ~~complete ease of experience~~    
[x] confusion   
[x] frustration    
[x] despair   

that comes with leaving the \*hand-holding honeymoon\* phase, and you thought you were the only one suffering from self-doubt and anxiety. Who would have known that this was typical of **all** coding students?   
Well, let's start this over. Right now, in your past, my present, Project 4 has just been approved and you're embracing markdown since writing your first--rather terse--README. Your older brother is lending you money to continue the course and you've outlined a course of action which may or may not be naively optimistic. But I won't hold that against you _this_ time.
Here are two truths you must remember:  
> Being wrong means you're not right just yet  

and,
>Success is about developing skills through practice  '

When you get stuck, in order to limit your time in the desert of despair, keep a few tools handy:
- step away for a little while
- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and others
- forums
- review material
- break the problem down into manageable chunks

Please remember these.

My objective is to regain employment this summer as a self-confident front-end web developer. I want to develop a lifestyle that looks forward to creating new and helpful sites and keeps me current in relevant trends in tech without veering into obsession.

I'd like to know how a little bit about how much successful web developers spend on tech news per day/week and what kind of sources do they go to for fun and inspiration.

And there we have it!

Sincerely,
CurrentDana
